This insight shows the total frequency of events over time. In the
default mode you can enter up to 3 events to compare their recent
trends. Weekends are marked with a separate color to help identify
weekly recurring patterns in the data.

By clicking and dragging over the chart you can create cohort
segments. A cohort segment contains users that have triggered the
chosen events within the selected time range.

You can compare the event trends between a segment of users and all
other users by selecting a single segment. When two segments are
selected, the chart shows a comparison of event trends between the
selected segments.
